### JS Mapmaker
This was a project I was working on for a while using PIXI.js. It was going to be a mapmaker for a game I was going to make. 

# Controls
The controls are simple enough use <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> to move the map around use <kbd>-</kbd> and <kbd>+</kbd> to zoom in and out. All the editing functions are in the top left click their icon once to open and once again to close.
