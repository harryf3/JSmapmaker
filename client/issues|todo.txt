issue
decorators can overlay differently indexes need to be alphabetized or sorted in some way as without viewport will draw them how they were drawn.

issue/todo
I don't really like how the mapmaker is turning out it's pretty convuloted and overall I think can be done better


todo
I'd like the structure system in the viewport to be different than decorators to allow for larger structures
